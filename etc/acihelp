The rmsgw_aci program is normally run every 30 minutes  from cron
(please choose an arbitrary minute (and its +30) to run, as opposed
to running right on each hour and half hour).

The crontab entry (for the rmsgw user) will look like:
19,49 * * * * /usr/local/bin/rmspg_aci >/dev/null 2>&1

See the rmsgw_aci man page for more information.

The auto check in involves updating availablity in the Winlink 2000
